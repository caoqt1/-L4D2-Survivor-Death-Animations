# [L4D2] Survivor Death Animations
Common Infected death animations for survivors.

## What is this?
This is a watered down port to [Sourcemod](https://www.sourcemod.net/) of [Shadowsyn's workshop addon](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1946304784). This will make survivors play common infected death on death. More features to come (such as female anims)

You will not play the death animation if any of these requirements are met:
1. You are incapacitated.
2. You are being tongued by a smoker, rode by a jockey, or pounced by a hunter.
3. You die to a tank punch / tank rock
4. You die to fall damage

 If any of these happen to you, you'll be ragdolled.
